Changing the Git history of your repository using a script

We've created a script that will change any commits that previously had the old email address in its author or committer fields to use the correct name and email address.

Note: Running this script rewrites history for all repository collaborators. After completing these steps, any person with forks or clones must fetch the rewritten history and rebase any local changes into the rewritten history.
